Name: Customer Churn Prediction
Description: |
  ðŸ“‰ **Customer Churn Prediction** aims to predict which customers are likely to leave a company using historical data. 
  This project uses the **Telecom Churn dataset** from Kaggle, applying **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree** models 
  to classify customers as "Churn" or "No Churn".
  
  The pipeline includes:
  - Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
  - Feature Engineering
  - Model Training and Tuning
  - Evaluation with **AUC**, **Precision**, and **Recall**
  
  This project is built in **R** using packages such as:
  - Tidyverse
  - Caret
  - Rpart
  - pROC
